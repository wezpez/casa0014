About the plant "Frank":
![Frank](thePlant.jpeg?raw=true)

Scientific Name: Begonia Maculata
Light Requirements: Bright, indirect light. Higher light levels will promote strong growth and blooms, but avoid direct sunlight.
Temperature: Between 18°C and 30°C.
Humidity: High humidity is important. >45% ideally. A digital hygrometer can be useful to monitor humidity.

Plans for the Future:
- I would like to integrate the solar panel component in oder to give power to the components as well as measure the amount of sunlight the plant is hypothetically getting
- Add a display to show the data gathered to the user directly
