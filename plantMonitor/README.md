## About the plant "Frank":
![Frank](thePlant.jpeg?raw=true)

- **Scientific Name:** Begonia Maculata
- **Light Requirements:** Bright, indirect light. Higher light levels will promote strong growth and blooms, but avoid direct sunlight.
- **Temperature:** Between 18°C and 30°C.
- **Humidity:** High humidity is important. >45% ideally.

## Difficulties during the project:
- Defining the values for the humidity sensor (what values really mean in relation to plant health)
- My prototype never created consistent or reliable results

## Plans for the Future:
- I would like to integrate the solar panel component in oder to give power to the components as well as measure the amount of sunlight the plant is hypothetically getting
- Add a display to show the data gathered to the user directly
